# Organizing local MP4 videos

There are various applications than can organize and play our locally stored MP4 videos but besides that, maybe we would like to organize them in a custom way.

To easily accomplish that, we could create the neccessary HTML code and access our videos in a quick, simple and fully customizable way.

Firstly, we will need to create Python lists with the filenames of our videos. Each Python list, will contain a few videos that we consider them as one group.

To simplify things, we assume that the videos we are interestd are stored in a single folder (but not inside any subfolders) and we will create five Python lists with those videos, each one containing the filenames that we consider as an individual group.

Thus, we will split our videos into five groups and we will use button to select which group will be displayed on our browser.
